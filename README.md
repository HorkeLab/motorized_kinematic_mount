# Description
This repository contains all files to convert a KM100 kinematic mirror mount from thorlabs (https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=KM100#ad-image-0) into a motorized mount, with computer controller tip/tilt. This implementation is a further development of the previous work by Luis Jos√© Salazar-Serrano and sources cited therein -  https://github.com/totesalaz/MKM

Here we provide both the 3D model, as well as .stl files of the individual parts that need to be printed.

Parts needed are:
- 1x Motor mount
- 1x Bracket
- 2x Knob adapter

To computer control the motors we use an Arduino MEGA with sensor shield, as described here - https://github.com/HorkeLab/arduino_28BYJ-48

# Printing Instructions

We have printed these in both PLA and PETG without problems. A well-calibrated printer is necessary to avoid excessive friction/stalling of the motors. Typically printed on 0.4mm nozzle, 0.2mm layer height, 15\% infill.
